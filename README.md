<h1>A-HLS omniRating Documentation</h1>

omniRating is a simple LWC that can be placed in an OmniScript to allow a user to rank something 1 through 5 stars.  After the user selects their ranking the LWC writes bacl to the OmniScript JSON in the form of Step:1:CustomLWC1:rating:[selected rating will show up here 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5].  Once this data is stored in the JSON you can then send it to a DataRaptor, Integration Procedure, or do whatever you like.

3. Add the CustomLWC that you installed to an OmniScript of your choosing. 
4. Configure the custom properties for the LWC to define the size and branding. The following are the available properties which can be configured:
    1. *size* - Example value: 30px.  This will set the size of the stars
    2. *setcolor* - True. This will allow the color of the stars to be changed
    3. *selected* - Example value: #222212 (RGB HEX Value)
    4. *hover* - RGB Hex Value
    5. *notselected* - RGB Hex Value

NOTE: If you selects a color for â€˜selected' use a darker color for 'hover' and then an even darker color for 'notselected' to get a nice effect.
